Castle is a device intelligence platform that offers you a holistic view of risky customers across web and mobile, and lets you implement mitigation workflows faster than any ever before.

With Castle, you can:

* Perform [Device Fingerprinting](/docs/device-fingerprinting) to uniquely identify devices that survive resets
* Use [Risk Scoring](/docs/risk-scoring) to detect bots, account takeovers, and general account abuse
* Use [Lists](/docs/lists) to _block_ or _trust_ any entity, including devices, IPs, and users
* Use [Policies](/docs/creating-a-policy) to implement no-code rules
* Use [Custom Signals](/docs/custom-signals) to implement real-time velocity queries that'll tag risky events

Now, let's get started with the implementation by reading the [Quickstart guide](/docs/quickstart).

Or if you first want to check out the [API Reference](https://reference.castle.io).
