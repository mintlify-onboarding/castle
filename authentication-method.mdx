title: "Authentication Method"
---

The optional `authentication_method` object can be used for any of the following events:

* `$registration` – what method was used to create the user account
* `$login` – what method was used to create a new authentication session
* `$challenge` – what method was requested from or resolved by the users as additional verification

By sending this information, not only does it provide valuable insight during fraud investigations when used to filter down the dataset as well as configuring policies, but it also helps improve Castle's risk models.
