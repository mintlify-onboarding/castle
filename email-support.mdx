## Technical Support

Email support is available for all Castle plans. If you have questions or problems, reach out on [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e4979194948b9690a4878597908881ca8d8b)

## Support Business Hours

Castle’s Support teams work standard business hours (roughly 9:00 AM to 5:30 PM, Monday through Friday) across the US Pacific as CEST time zones. Please note, however, that your specific support hours will be governed by the terms and conditions of your Agreement.

Saturdays, Sundays, and local holidays are not considered “standard business hours”. On these days, our staffing may be limited, which could delay responses.
