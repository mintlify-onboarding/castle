#### How your Castle org's admins and users will be impacted by setting up Required 2FA

Once you have clicked 'Confirm' to set up required 2FA for your Castle Org, any admins or users who have already set up 2FA in their individual account settings will be prompted for 2FA every time they log in to the Castle Dashboard. 

Any admins or users who have not yet set up 2FA in their individual account settings will be prompted to set up 2FA the next time they log in to the Castle Dashboard. 

Any admins or users who you invite to join your Castle org after you've set up required MFA for your org will be required to set up 2FA during the account creation process. 

Instructions on how to set up 2FA within your account settings can be found [here](/docs/enabling-two-factor-auth).

## 2FA Verification for Team Admins

Team administrators can check which team members have enabled 2FA on their account by looking at the Team page in the dashboard.
