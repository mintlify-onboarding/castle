| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $login                    | A user logging into your application. See [Protecting the login](/docs/login-activity)                                                                                                                     |
| $registration             | A visitor signing up to become a user of your application. See [Protecting the registration](/docs/registration-activity)                                                                                  |
| $profile\_update          | A user updating their email, phone, name, or password.                                                                                                                                                     |
| $profile\_reset           | A user resetting their email, phone, name, or password.                                                                                                                                                    |

| $password\_reset\_request | A visitor initiating a password reset flow. This event is not meant to be used for when a visitor _completes_ the resetting of their password, which is where you'd instead send a $profile\_update event. |
| $challenge                | A user is sent through an additional verification flow, such as CAPTCHA, Two-factor or Email-verification. This event supports the status $requested in addition to $failed and $succeeded.                |
| $custom                   | Any business-specific user activity that's not covered by the events above. The status field isn't supported for these events, and you should instead populate name.                                       |
