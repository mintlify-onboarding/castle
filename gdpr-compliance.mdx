### User data access requests

GDPR introduced [Article 15: Right of access by the data subject](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/). This states that users have the right to request access to the data held on them. If you receive this request from your user, you may also need to forward the request to your vendors, such as Castle, so that the vendor can provide data related to this user as well. Castle offers an API endpoint to submit these User Data Access Requests.

#### Setting your privacy email address

In the Castle Dashboard, you first need to enter your companyâ€™s privacy email address. This email address must then be verified. Once you have saved and verified an email address, Castle will send any data request results to that email address. To set your privacy email address, log into your Castle dashboard and visit **Settings > General**.

![:warning:](/images/warning.png ":warning:") **Important:** This email address should only be accessible to employees that are responsible for handling user privacy related matters.

Castle offers an API endpoint to submit these User Data Purge Requests.
