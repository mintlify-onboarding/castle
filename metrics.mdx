With Metrics, you're able to set up rate limiting rules based on time and counters, e.g. to block requests with more than 10 failed logins per IP in the last hour, or when the number of users per device exceeds 2\. All Metrics can be used in [Policies](/docs/creating-a-policy) and [Custom Signals](/docs/custom-signals), as part of the trigger condition, and in the Explore view, where you're able to efficiently tune the thresholds based on historic data and see the impact in real time. 

Castle allows to create your own business specific metrics. For example:

* **Number of logins and registrations per IP, last hour**. Ideal for rate limiting and blocking spam behavior.
* **Number of users per device**. Helpful to stop excessive multi-accounting, while allowing normal usage to go on without friction.
* **Number of users per IP, last day**. Also useful to strengthen your defenses against multi-accounting.
* **Counts per IP, User and Device fingerprint for custom events**. By using [API Custom Parameters](/docs/api-custom-parameters) when tracking event, you will be able to utilize these custom parameters in Metrics.

### Creating a Metric

To create a new metric, head over to the [Metrics](https://dashboard.castle.io/v2/metrics) page. When you create a metric, you have to define the following things:

1. **A name.** This will appear as the reference across the Castle Dashboard, e.g. when creating a new filter of defining a trigger condition for Policies and Custom Signals.
2. **Description (optional).** An optional longer description to communicate the intent of this Metric. This can be useful for other team members to better understand the behavior.
3. **A Metric Value.** See below for more details. It allows you to create a time-series query (an aggregation) that produces a number that can be used in the trigger condition. E.g. "Failed login attempts per IP".

### Aggregations

When you create a new Metric you'll have to define an Aggregation query that runs alongside and is evaluated in real-time. With aggregations, you're able to create advanced velocity checks that can detect suspicious patterns in all sorts of activities, both transaction and non-transaction. For example, compute the average transaction amount per user in the last 24h:

Defining a new aggregation is done from within the panel for creating a new Metric, and consists of a few parameters. For those familiar with SQL, parameters for an Aggregation are overall very similar to the parts that make up a (streaming) SQL statement, e.g.

SQL

`SELECT $count_unique(properties.referral_code)
FROM events
WHERE name = 'Redeem'
GROUP BY user.id
WINDOW (SIZE 1 HOUR)
HAVING $count_unique(properties.referral_code) > 1 -- trigger condition, defined by the signal
`

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name      | A short description of the Aggregation, like "Transactions per user". This will be used as a reference when defining metric value formula.                                                                                                                    |
| Method    | The aggregation method together with a potential argument. Available options are:\- Average ($avg)\- Count Events ($count)\- Count Unique ($count\_unique)\- First Value ($first)\- Last Value ($last)\- Max Value ($max)\- Minimum Value ($min)\- Sum ($sum) |
| Group By  | An optional argument that describes a grouping for the aggregation. For example, you can pick user.id to split up transaction volume per user instead of computing it across the entire app.                                                                  |
| Where     | Define optional filters to apply before computing the aggregation. For example, you can filter by $transaction type events to count all transactions per user.                                                                                                |
| Within    | Time window over which to compute the Aggregation. Maximum is 180 days.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The output from each aggregation is a value (typically a number) that is used to calculate final metric value. With a single aggregation, metric value is equal to the aggregation value. For now only a single aggregation is allowed per metric. More is coming soon. Follow our [Changelog](/changelog) to stay tuned.

### Filtering by metrics

You'll find all Metrics under filters and the "Metrics" section:

### Using Metrics in Custom Signals and Policies

Any metric can be used in filters for the trigger condition of a Custom Signal or Policy.

Metric in Custom Signal's trigger condition

The same metric could be re-used across multiple Custom Signals or Policies, which allows to tag events with different signals or perform different policy actions based on different thresholds for the metric. E.g. when you have multiple failed logins from the same IP address, you can setup policy to "challenge" on a third attempt and "deny" after tenth failed logins.

### Managing Metrics

From the Metrics page you can perform standard action like create, update or archive metrics. In addition, these metrics can also be temporarily disabled, which means that incoming events will no longer have those metrics computed.

> Please note, if you disable a metric that is used in active policies or custom signals, their trigger condition won't match any events since metric value is not computed.
