## cURL

Sometimes it's easier to first run a simple cURL example. In the example below, replace `YOUR_API_SECRET` with the one from your settings, and optionally replace the [test request token](/docs/test-tokens) `test|device:firefox_on_windows` with a real one generated by your client SDK.

cURL

`curl --location --request POST 'https://api.castle.io/v1/filter' \
-u ':YOUR_API_SECRET' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
   "type": "$registration",
   "status": "$attempted",
   "request_token": "test|device:firefox_on_windows",
   "context":{
